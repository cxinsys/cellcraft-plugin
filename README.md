# CellCraft Plugins

This repository contains plugin configurations and information for [CellCraft](https://github.com/cxinsys/cellcraft), a web-based visual programming application for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference.

## Overview

CellCraft integrates multiple GRN reconstruction tools through its modular plugin system. This repository serves as a central hub for managing and documenting all available plugins that can be used within the CellCraft environment.
